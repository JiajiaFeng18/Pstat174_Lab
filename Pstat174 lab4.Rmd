## Question 1


```{r}
# a.Exploratory Data Analysis
plot(sales, main="Monthly Sales Data", xlab="Month", ylab="Sales")
adf.test(sales)
acf(sales)
pacf(sales)

# b.Transformation (if needed)
sales_log <- log(sales) # Log transformation
sales_diff <- diff(sales_log, differences = 1) # Log differencing

# c.Model Identification + Fit ARIMA Models with auto.arima, including top 3 models
auto_fit <- auto.arima(sales_log, trace = TRUE, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE)

# Assuming auto.arima suggests ARIMA(p,d,q) as the best model and two alternatives for comparison.

# d.Parameter Estimation and fitting models manually
# Fit the top model suggested by auto.arima
fit1 <- Arima(sales_log, 
              order = c(auto_fit$arma[1], auto_fit$arma[6], auto_fit$arma[2]), 
              seasonal = c(auto_fit$arma[3], auto_fit$arma[7], auto_fit$arma[4]), 
              include.drift = auto_fit$arma[5]>0)
summary(fit1)

# Fit the 2nd and 3nd best models manually, I have identified them based on the trace output.
# Example orders are placeholders; replace with actual orders from auto.arima trace output
fit2 <- Arima(sales_log, order = c(2, 1, 2), include.drift = TRUE)
summary(fit2)

fit3 <- Arima(sales_log, order = c(1, 1, 3), include.drift = FALSE)
summary(fit3)

# e.Residual Diagnostics + Model Choice
checkresiduals(fit1)
checkresiduals(fit2)
checkresiduals(fit3)

# Model Comparison
AIC(fit1, fit2, fit3)
BIC(fit1, fit2, fit3)

#Fit1 is the chosen model after comparison
best_model <- fit1
summary(best_model)

```

## Question 2
```{r}
library(astsa)
data(lead)
data(sales)

diff_sales <- diff(sales, differences = 1)
diff_lead <- diff(lead, differences = 1)
adf.test(diff_sales)
adf.test(diff_lead)
ccf(diff_lead, diff_sales, lag.max=10, main="Cross-Correlation between diff_lead and diff_sales")
lag2.plot(diff_lead, diff_sales)

```

## Question 3
```{r}
library(dynlm)

# Differencing
d.sales <- diff(sales, differences = 1)
d.lead <- diff(lead, differences = 1)

# Stationarity Test
adf.test(d.sales)
adf.test(d.lead)


fit_model_dyn <- dynlm(d.sales ~ L(d.lead, 3))
summary(fit_model_dyn)

# Examine residuals (to decide on an ARMA model)
residuals <- resid(fit_model_dyn)
acf(residuals, main="ACF of Residuals")
pacf(residuals, main="PACF of Residuals")

# Fit ARMA model to residuals (based on ACF/PACF analysis)
arma_fit <- auto.arima(residuals)
summary(arma_fit)


final_resid <- residuals(arma_fit)
acf(final_resid, main="ACF of Final Model Residuals")
pacf(final_resid, main="PACF of Final Model Residuals")


```
```{r}
# Discussion of results
"Stationary Tests:
The p-value for d.sales is 0.06585, and for d.lead is 0.01.
d.lead's p-value is smaller than 0.05, lead to rejecting the null hypothesis of a unit root,
indicating stationarity."

"Regression Model Summary:
The estimated coefficient for L(d.lead, 3) is 3.33733, and p-value is < 2.2e-16.
This p-value is far below any conventional significance level, 
indicating that we can reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero.
This coefficient suggests a strong positive relationship between the lead data lagged by three periods 
and the sales data.Changes in the lead data are associated with changes in the sales data in the 
same direction three periods later."

"Final Model Residuals:
The ACF of the residuals shows a significant spike at lag 1 
and then quickly diminishes and stays within the confidence bounds for the subsequent lags.
This is a possible AR(1) process.
The PACF plot does not show any significant spikes, 
suggesting that there may not be a need for additional MA terms."
