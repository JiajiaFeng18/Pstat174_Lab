## Problem 1

### (a)
```{r}
plot(gnp, main="GNP Time Series", xlab="Time", ylab="GNP")
"In this plot, the GNP is clearly increasing over time, indicating a trend in the data. 
The variance also appears to be increasing as the level of GNP rises, 
which is another sign of non-stationarity."
```
### (b)
```{r}
log_diff_gnp <- diff(log(gnp))
plot(log_diff_gnp, main="Log Differences of GNP Time Series", xlab="Time", ylab="Log Difference of GNP")
```

### (c)
```{r}
library(astsa)
acf2(log_diff_gnp)
```

### (d)
```{r}
library(forecast)
ma.model <- Arima(log_diff_gnp, order=c(0,0,2))
summary(ma.model)
```
### (e)
```{r}
residuals <- ma.model$residuals
plot(residuals, main="Residuals of MA(2) Model", ylab="Residuals", xlab="Time")
abline(h=0, col="red")
Acf(residuals, main="ACF of Residuals")
"The absence of patterns in the residuals and the lack of significant autocorrelation 
in the ACF plot collectively suggest that the MA(2) model is a good fit for the data."
```
### (f)
```{r}
ar.model <- Arima(log_diff_gnp, order=c(1,0,0)) # AR(1) model
summary(ar.model)
```
```{r}
plot(ar.model$residuals, main="Residuals of AR(1) Model", ylab="Residual", xlab="Time")
abline(h=0, col="blue", lty=2)
Acf(ar.model$residuals, main="ACF of Residuals for AR(1) Model", lag.max=20)

```

### (g)
```{r}
plot(log_diff_gnp, main="Log Differenced GNP with Fitted Models", 
     ylab="Log Differenced GNP", xlab="Time")
lines(ma.model$fitted, col="red")
lines(ar.model$fitted, col="blue")
legend("topright", legend=c("MA(2) Fitted", "AR(1) Fitted"), col=c("red", "blue"), lty=1)

```

## Problem2

### (a)
```{r}
library(astsa)
data(xglobtemp)
plot(xglobtemp, main="Global Temperature Time Series", xlab="Year", ylab="Temperature")
"The data does not appear to be stationary due to the following reasons:"
"Trend: There is a clear upward trend over time. The temperature is increasing, 
which indicates that the mean of the series is not constant.
Variance: The increasing trend might suggest that the variance could be changing as well, 
particularly if the rate of increase is not constant."

"Seasonal Trend:
The plot does not immediately suggest a strong seasonal component; 
the fluctuations appear irregular rather than systematic throughout the series. "
"Removing Seasonal Trend: 
If there's an underlying seasonal trend not visible in the current plot, 
apply seasonal differencing, which involves subtracting the observation from the same season 
in the previous cycle."
```
### (b)
```{r}
# Assuming xglobtemp is your global temperature time series data
diff_xglobtemp <- diff(xglobtemp, differences = 1)

# Producing a time series plot of the differenced data
plot(diff_xglobtemp, main="Differenced Global Temperature Time Series", xlab="Year", ylab="Differenced Temperature")
"The data appears to be stationary.
The mean seems to fluctuate along temperature 0.0, which indicates stationarity.
There are no obvious periods of high or low variability, 
which indicates stationarity in terms of variance.
There is no evident seasonal pattern in the differenced data from the plot provided. 
"
```

### (c)
```{r}
library(astsa)
log_xglobtemp <- log(xglobtemp)
log_diff_xglobtemp <- diff(log_xglobtemp) 

acf2(log_diff_xglobtemp)

```
```{r}
"
ACF Observations:
The ACF shows that there are a few lags that are outside the confidence bounds, notably the first lag. 
However, the autocorrelations quickly fall within the bounds and become insignificant. 
This initial spike suggests some level of autocorrelation that may need to be 
accounted for by an MA term.
PACF Observations:
The PACF plot shows a significant spike at the first lag and then the correlations 
taper off into the confidence bounds. 
This suggests a possible AR(1) component as the most significant predictor, 
with subsequent lags being statistically insignificant."
"Potential ARIMA Model:
The ACF and PACF plots suggest that an ARIMA(1,1,1) model may be appropriate for the 
log-differenced data. 
This model includes one autoregressive term, one order of differencing 
(which has already been applied to make the data stationary), and one moving average term."
```

### (d)
```{r}
library(astsa)
sarima_model <- sarima(log_diff_xglobtemp, 1, 1, 1)
```

### (e)
```{r}
library(astsa)
fit <- sarima(xglobtemp, 1, 1, 1)
"Standardized Residuals Plot: 
The residuals here seem to be fluctuating around zero without any clear pattern, which is good.
"
"ACF of Residuals Plot:
All the autocorrelation bars are within the confidence bounds, 
suggesting that the residuals are white noise."

"Normal Q-Q Plot of Standardized Residuals:
The points generally follow the line, but with some deviation at the ends. 
This is fairly common and might not be a problem, 
but it indicates that the residuals have heavier tails than a normal distribution."
"P-values for Ljung-Box Statistic:
All p-values are high, which suggests that there is no significant autocorrelation in the residuals."
